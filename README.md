# learning-processing
This is a repository for the files I make while following tutorials from Daniel Shiffman's, i.e., The Coding Train's, videos associated with his "Learning Processing" book. http://learningprocessing.com/videos/

I did the tutorials from chapter 1 to chapter 8 part 2 from 19th April 2021 to 3rd June 2021.
